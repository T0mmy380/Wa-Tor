The goal of adding multithreading to the Wa-Tor simulation was to improve performance by distributing the work across multiple CPU cores. However, the results clearly showed that increasing the thread count led to worse performance, with speedup values consistently dropping below 1.0. This means the simulation actually ran slower when using 2, 4, or 8 threads compared to just a single thread.
